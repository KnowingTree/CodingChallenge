# CodingChallenge
<p> Navigate to root directory of the project </p>
<p> Execute "./gradlew build" and "./gradlew shadowJar". The project now builds itself and creates a jar file with all dependencies</p>
<p> In "build/libs" you find "CodingChallenge-0.1-all.jar", which is the result of the shadowJar command </p>
<p> This jar can now be executed with the required parameters: "java -jar >pathToFile< >numberOfViewSpots<" </p>
